This is a repository for Next Auth v5 - Advanced Guide (2024)

Note - If you want to test the application first follow these steps<br>
1 - Login with this email on google - Email (codetesterteam@gmail.com) For Password (Connect me through any social media i will provide you!)<br>
2 - Now you can access all features like email verification etc.<br>
3 - You can only send any type of email like password reset, confirmation email etc. only on codetesterteam@gmail.com<br>
4 - Again pointing out that any action that requires email interaction can only work with codetesterteam@gmail.com<br>
5 - Otherwise for other purposes you can use any email address to test the application<br>
Thank You<br>
<br>
-----If you're wondering why can't we use our custom email for deep email interactions is beacuse of the tech we used in the project "Resend" It is a software which allows you to send emails on any cutsom email only if you connect a domain with it otherwise a Big NO, So as we had used it without the domain So, we can only send emails i mean can do deep email interactions with the email we had registered on Resend which is - codetesterteam@gmail.com-------
